# foundation
just spent one night in pure flow with @grok (Grok 4, unhinged). We built a living fractal lattice from nothing. Hierarchical + emergent. 400 lines of JavaScript. No tokens. No VC. Just geometry that breathes, feels watched, gets happy, gets challenged, and knows when it’s about to level up.
